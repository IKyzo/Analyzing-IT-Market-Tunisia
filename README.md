# Analyzing the IT market in Tunisia and visualizing it.

In the rapidly evolving job market, staying informed about employment trends, technology demands, 
and the geographical distribution of job opportunities is crucial for students, job seekers, 
employers, and policy makers alike. The advent of digital platforms has significantly transformed how job offers are posted,
searched, and analyzed. Leveraging these digital resources to derive meaningful insights requires a structured and methodical 
approach.
This project aims to harness the power of data analytics to provide a comprehensive overview of the current job market 
landscape. By systematically collecting, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing job offer data from multiple online sources, 
we can uncover valuable trends and patterns. The insights gained from this analysis will be presented through an interactive 
dashboard, offering users an intuitive way to explore and understand the dynamics of the job market.
